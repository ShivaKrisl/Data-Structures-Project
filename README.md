# Data-Structures-Project
One of the major challenges that have remained in perpetual prosperity and existence in the world’s largest democracy is the absence of free and fair elections, which leaves room for various ill-practices, corruption, planning, or voting rights, as well as a crisis of competitive and healthy political competition, instead of focusing on the display of brute power.
Current Voting systems like EVM and Ballot Box Voting has many Disadvantages like:
1.Voter Always need to go Polling Booth to Cast his Vote
2. Votes Altering i.e. A Single Person can Vote for multiple times to manipulate the Vote Counts.
3. Votes Counting becomes even more difficult when Ballot Box Voting is Used.
4. In order to announce results. It requires a large number of days and sometimes even weeks.

➢	The main purpose of this project is to provide a simple and mini Online Voting application that can overcome the drawbacks of existing Voting Systems.
The project key idea is:
1.	Here the EC(Election Commissioner) will be in charge of Admin. 
2.	The admin can login using his User ID and Password.
3.	On successful Login he can add Candidates by his names and Parties. These are stored using linked list.
4.	On the Voters Side, first they Need to register using NAME, AGE and VOTER ID. Here validation for AGE has been checked in order to not to violate Voting Rules.
5.	Upon Successful Login voters Can see Candidates added by ADMIN . He can vote  as he wish.
6.	The results are automatically updated.
7.	This Enables us to count votes quickly.
